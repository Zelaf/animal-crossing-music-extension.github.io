### Weather Variants ☔
You may remember that the background hourly music changed slightly on days when it rained or snowed.

The extension also features 'raining' and 'snowing' variants of all hourly tracks! You can choose which variant you want to listen to, or set it to 'random'. 


### Live Weather Support 📍
You can enable Weather Detection so weather variants of the hourly music can be automatically picked according to the weather in your location!

### MediaSession Support 💽
We leverage Chrome's MediaSession API to display metadata of the currently playing song.

Through the Chrome Media UI you will be able to see the track title, source game and cover!
